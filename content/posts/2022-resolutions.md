2022 is here. And I wanted to be more open and share more about myself with the world. 

So starting a new blog. This will be a collection of my thoughts various topics.

One of the first will be probably be the dreaded blog configuration post. Wanted as low of a friction about publishing so chose hugo and a theme that seems to have most everything inbuild. Might add disqus later, if needed.

I bake somewhat regularly, so will share some pictures here along with recipe reviews.

Have been a software engineer since February 2016, so have some thoughts on that.

Also have a personal project going on where I am watching all the Osacar winners in somewhat chronological order, so some movie reviews.

And if I get back to writing fiction, or add any new hobbby, will add it here.
