This barely qualifies under cooking, but just in case.
Here is how I make coffee 2-3 times a day.

## Sources
This is combined from [James Hoffman's youtube coffee videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VlT_jUVPc) and reddit [r/coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/).

## Equipment

I use [AeroPress]((https://aeropress.com/)) and a hand held [Hario mini coffee grinder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001804CLY/).

Total cost of the setup i.e. AeroPress with metal filters and coffee grinder  was about 50-60 dollars. It has lasted me at least 2 years.

## Recipe

About 12-13 g of coffee. The grinder is set at 3 or 4 clicks, IIRC.

Put slightly more than a cup of water in the measuring cup. Use  microwave on high for 2 minutes.
While water is boiling, start grinding. Put the coffee in an inverted aero press. Pour water. Wait for 2 minute 30 seconds again, and invert [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/) over the coffee mug and press. I usually add one sachet of saccharin sweetener. Also, I add some milk to the left over water and heat it for 30 seconds and mix it together with the brewed coffee. Quantity of milk and water mix depends on how acidic the coffee is. Currently I prefer coffee's that tastes quite close to chocolate notes.

I use Trade Coffee to get coffee delivered. I do have too pause every 3 months or so, since the my method of brewing doesn't use too much coffee by weight.

It probably has diverged substantially from the videos, but I am not very fussy.

Bad thing about making your own coffee is that I really find the bitterness in office coffee unappealing.

Also, if you want to really get an idea of how acidic coffee can get, leave it inside the hot water for 30 minutes while you attend a meeting and then taste it. I think it was worse than vinegar.
