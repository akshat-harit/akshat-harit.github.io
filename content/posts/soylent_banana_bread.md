I tried to go the soylent route a while back. Not really sure why, except I was probably on a self improvement kick and probably thought of time spent on food as a time waste.
I gave up on it pretty quickly as food is much more important to me than just nutrition.

But I did find a sort of complete meal banana bread recipe that I still make sometime. The macros are semi decent, IIRC.

The completefoods site seems down, so just adding a copy here for my own use

Baked Banana Soylent Bread v5.0 [wheat][moist!] - 2400 kcal by abemore

## Ingredients

- Salt(1/2 tsp)
- Canola Oil(100g). I usually reduced it somewhat to 70g if I wanted to lower the fat amount. Does effect texture.
- Whole wheat flour(187g)
- Bananas(500g)
- Baking soda(1/2 tsp)
- Vanilla protein powder(100 g)
- Cinnamon(1 tsp). I added other spices like cloves, cardamom as well.

I also usually add chocolate chips.

## Recipe

While normally when baking I would advocate mixing the ingredients separately, and avoiding over mixing.

Because lets face it, banana bread is a cake and you normally want to inhibit gluten formation as much as possible. But this is strictly a utilitarian recipe.

Best taste and texture is not really a goal, as long as it is something acceptable.

- Use a blender to mix banana- and oil.
- Add protein powder, wheat flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Make sure to blend well to mix baking soda uniformly.
- Add chocolate chips, if using.
- Put it in a bread pan that has been thoroughly greased and floured. I have not had issue with it sticking to the pan, but you can use parchment if you want to be extra safe.
- Bake at 325 F. The original link states 30 minutes, but I think it took me about 40-50 minutes. I'll update timing when I make it again.

## Comments

I usually eat it after microwaving and with sugar free jam.
It is acceptable.
