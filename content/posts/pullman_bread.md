I bake frequently and one thing I have missed while baking is square shaped sandwich bread. Plopping dough into a dutch oven is nice and all, but if I want a peanut butter sandwich, I want something square. So I recently got a pullman loaf pan.

Recipe for 8.3 x 4.8 x 4.4 inches pan. It is labeled as Pullman Loaf Pan with Lid 1lb (450g). I have no idea what 450 g means here. I presume it is flour, but hydration level would vary across different doughs. So not sure it would be have the correct volume for all the dough that had 450 g flour.

Rough recipe proportions and baking time source from here [https://merryboosters.com/pullman-bread-recipe/](https://merryboosters.com/pullman-bread-recipe/). I used oil instead of butter so upped the water content by 20 ml.

## Ingredients

- 500 g Flour
- 335 ml water(so 67% hydration, I think. Not sure we count other stuff in hydration percentages.)
- Random sprinkling of yeast
- 2 teaspoon salt
- 3 tbsp Sugar
- 30 g olive oil.

## Recipe

- Mix it together.
- Leave in the fridge for 2-3 days.
- Put it in the greased loaf pan. Cold dough is easier to shape.
- Wait 2-3 hours.
- Bake at 375 F for 40 minutes.
- Take it out of the pan soonish. Otherwise steam will be in the pan and make it soggy.
- Leave on wire rack to dry out

## Thoughts

My main motivation here is texture and shape, and plain flavor with minimum effort.
It was mostly square. Edges had some taper, but not enough to care about too much.

It still has more flavor than I want. Weirdly I want bread to be flavorless for a peanut butter jelly sandwich, but that is hard to do with a no knead recipe. But I am too lazy to do the kneading.

I'll probably experiment with adding corn meal, whole wheat flour etc. next time.
